# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with Legion quickly. We'll cover the basic setup and show you how to create your first multi-agent system.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

```bash
pip install legion
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of creating an agent:

```python
from legion.agents import agent
from legion.interface.decorators import tool

@agent(model="openai:gpt-4-turbo", temperature=0.2)
class SimpleAgent:
    """A simple agent that can perform basic tasks"""
    
    @tool
    def greet(self, name: str) -> str:
        """Greet someone by name"""
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

async def main():
    agent = SimpleAgent()
    response = await agent.aprocess("Greet someone named Alice")
    print(response.content)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```
